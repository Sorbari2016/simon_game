## Project Objective
- For this project, I am tasked to build the classical Simon electronic game.

## About The Simon Game
### Brief Overview
- The Simon game is memory game where players repeat sequences of lights and sounds.

### How it works
- The game shows the first colour in the sequence (for example blue). The user clicks on the blue button.
- Next, the game shows the next colour (for example red), the user has to remember the sequence is blue, red and so on and so forth.

## Tools 
- HTML.
- CSS.
- JQuery.
